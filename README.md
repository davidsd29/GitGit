# My GitHub Yu-Gi-Oh Cards

You might be thinking, "Nice and all, but what exactly am I looking at?" Well, this is my GitHub account with a custom twist! I showcase all my repositories through Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

This GitHub repository is a web application that allows you to view my GitHub repositories displayed as Yu-Gi-Oh cards. To retrieve the repository information, I use the GitHub API. I created this page using the Vite build tool and developed it using the React framework.

## Technologies Used

The languages and technologies used in this project include:
- React
- HTML
- SCSS/CSS
